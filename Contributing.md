## Code Contributions

This project is written in Rust based on a bunch of nice crates. The
code should be auto-formatted using `rustfmt`.

There are some tests, that can be run using the `run-tests.sh` script
in the source root. These are also run on CI. The CI pipeline builds
this app for/on different platforms. This happens when a PR is
created on each change.
